Welcome to the home page of my portfolio. Here you can find various financial analyses and visualisations. These analyses are projects I have worked on, showcasing my skills in data analysis and visualisation using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Yahoo Finance and Streamlit as well as tools such as MySQL, Git and AWS. These projects include stock market analysis, commodity forecasting, machine learning and portfolio management strategies. Each project is designed to provide insights into different data and guide users understanding of market trends. Feel free to explore the different sections and projects available in this portfolio. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to me through the contact page. If you are having issues viewing the page or it does not look correct you can press the three dots at the top of the screen, go to settings and turn on/off wide mode.

    My name is John Acton, but I usually go by JJ. I‚Äôm a recent graduate from Imperial College London with a postgraduate research master‚Äôs in Physics, where I focused on discovering new materials for next-generation solar cells. This work gave me a strong grounding in energy systems, data analysis and computational methods. Since then, I‚Äôve built on that by developing skills in AI, machine learning, and financial data analytics, working on projects that link energy research with market insights. This web app is a way for me to showcase how I use data and AI tools to analyse trends and support decision-making in energy and finance. Outside of work, I enjoy skiing, scuba diving, travelling, cooking and music.

    Below is a link to download my thesis, which focuses on the discovery of new materials for next-generation solar cells. It details my research methods, data analysis, and conclusions from my postgraduate studies at Imperial College London. While the work is grounded in energy materials science, it highlights skills that are highly relevant to data and AI-driven analysis: handling complex datasets, applying computational methods and drawing clear insights from research. These strengths carry over directly to roles in energy markets, financial analysis, and AI-based decision support.
